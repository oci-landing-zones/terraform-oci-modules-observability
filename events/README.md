# OCI Landing Zone Events Module

![Landing Zone logo](../landing_zone_300.png)

This module manages arbitrary events in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) based on a single configuration object. Events enable automation based on state changes of OCI resources and are a recommendation of Center for Internet Security (CIS) OCI Foundations Benchmark for raising awareness about changes in Identity and Access Management (IAM) and networking resources. 

Check [module specification](./SPEC.md) for a full description of module requirements, supported variables, managed resources and outputs.

Check the [examples](./examples/) folder for actual module usage.

## <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>
### Terraform Version >= 1.3.0

This module requires Terraform binary version 1.3.0 or greater, as it relies on Optional Object Type Attributes feature. The feature shortens the amount of input values in complex object types, by having Terraform automatically inserting a default value for any missing optional attributes.

### IAM Permissions

This module requires the following OCI IAM permissions in compartments where event rules, topics, subscriptions and streams are managed.

For deploying event rules:
```
Allow group <group> to manage cloudevents-rules in compartment <events-compartment-name>
```

If events are meant to be captured in the root compartment (as in the case of IAM resources), then the following permission is required:
```
Allow group <group> to manage cloudevents-rules in tenancy
```

For deploying topics and subscriptions:
```
Allow group <group> to manage ons-family in compartment <topic-compartment-name>
```

For deploying streams:
```
Allow group <group> to manage stream-family in compartment <stream-compartment-name>
```

## <a name="invoke">How to Invoke the Module</a>

Terraform modules can be invoked locally or remotely. 

For invoking the module locally, just set the module *source* attribute to the module file path (relative path works). The following example assumes the module is two folders up in the file system.
```
module "events" {
  source = "../.."
  events_configuration = var.events_configuration
}
```

For invoking the module remotely, set the module *source* attribute to the events module folder in this repository, as shown:
```
module "events" {
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability/events"
  events_configuration = var.events_configuration
}
```
For referring to a specific module version, append *ref=\<version\>* to the *source* attribute value, as in:
```
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability//events?ref=v0.1.0"
```
## <a name="functioning">Module Functioning</a>

In this module, events are defined using the *events_configuration* object, that supports the following attributes:
- **default_compartment_id**: the default compartment for all resources managed by this module. It can be overridden by *compartment_id* attribute in each resource. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either a compartment OCID or a reference (a key) to the compartment OCID. The reserved key "TENANCY-ROOT" references the root compartment OCID. When "TENANCY-ROOT" is utilized, variable *tenancy_ocid* is required.
- **default_defined_tags**: the default defined tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overridden by *defined_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **default_freeform_tags**: the default freeform tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overridden by *freeform_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **event_rules**: define the event types to capture and where to send them. **Each event rule is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined**. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys.
- **topics**: define the topics managed by this module that can be used as event destinations. **Each topic is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined**. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys.
- **streams**: define the streams managed by this module that can be used as event destinations. **Each stream is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined**. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys.

 ## Defining the Event Types to Capture

Within *event_rules*, the event types to capture can be specified in two ways: through pre-configured events categories or by supplying specific event types.

- **pre-configured events categories**: use the *preconfigured_events_categories* attribute, assigning it a list of the following supported values: *iam*, *network*, *storage*, *database*, *exainfra*, *compute*, *budget* and *cloudguard*. For the list of event types in each of these categories, check [preconfigured_events.tf file](./preconfigured_events.tf). 
- **supplied events**: use the *supplied_events* attribute, assigning it a list of valid OCI event type names. Event type names are service specific. Look at [Service that Produce Events](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/) for event types within each service.

**Note**: *supplied_events* takes precedence over *preconfigured_events_categories*.

Event rules are enabled by default. For disabling a rule, set *is_enabled* attribute to false.

### Naming Events Rules

Use *event_display_name* to name the event rule and *event_description* for the event rule description. *event_description* defaults to *event_display_name* if not provided.

### Events Filtering

The module allows for the specified events (either pre-configured or explicitly supplied) to be filtered. You can filter by an attribute or by a defined tag assigned to the resource for which the event is triggered. Look at [Matching Events with Filters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Events/Concepts/filterevents.htm) for details. 

For filtering by attribute, use *attributes_filter* attribute, providing a list of objects with attribute name and value. 

The example below matches events for resources with the specified *compartmentId* and *riskLevel*.
```
attributes_filter = [
  {
    attr = "compartmentId" 
    value = ["ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...cnq"]
  }
  {
    attr = "riskLevel" 
    value = ["CRITICAL"] 
  }
]
```                     
For filtering by tag, use *tags_filter* atribute, providing a list of defined tags. Within each tag, provide the tag namespace and a list of tag names and values. The example below matches events for resources tagged with *CostCenter*="1" and *OracleEmail*="email.address@example.com" in the *OracleInternalReserved* namespace.
```
tags_filter = [
  {
    namespace = "OracleInternalReserved"
    tags = [{name = "CostCenter", value = "1"}, {name = "OwnerEmail", value = "email.address@example.com"}]
  }
]
```
## Defining Where to Send Events

Within *event_rules* attribute, use the *destination_topic_ids*, *destination_stream_ids* and *destination_function_ids* attributes to define where to send captured events. 

- **destination_topic_ids**: a list of topics to send events to. This attribute is overloaded, i.e., it can be assigned a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. When assigned a reference, the module first looks up for the reference in the *topics* attribute for internally managed topics. Then it looks up in the *topics_dependency* variable for externally managed topics.
- **destination_stream_ids**: a list of streams to send events to. This attribute is overloaded, i.e., it can be assigned a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. When assigned a reference, the module first looks up for the reference in the *streams* attribute for internally managed streams. Then it looks up in the *stream_dependency* variable for externally managed streams.
- **destination_function_ids**: a list of OCI functions to send events to. This attribute is overloaded, i.e., it can be assigned a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. When assigned a reference, the module looks up for the reference in the *functions_dependency* variable for externally managed functions.

The example below shows the three destination types. Note that you can mix and match multiple OCIDs and references. 
```
destination_topic_ids = ["ocid1.onstopic.oc1.iad.aaaaaa...j5q", "NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY"] 
destination_stream_ids = ["ocid1.stream.oc1.iad.aaaaaa...ijk", "NETWORK-STREAM-KEY"] 
destination_function_ids = ["ocid1.fnfunc.oc1.iad.aaaaaa...3bq", "NETWORK-FUNCTION-KEY"]
```

## Defining Event Destinations

Within *events_configuration*, use the *topics* and *streams* attributes to define the topics and streams destinations managed by this module.

**Each topic and stream is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined**. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys. 

For each topic in the *topics* attribute, you can define their associated *subscriptions*, by specifying  respective *protocol* and *values*. Supported protocols are *EMAIL*, *CUSTOM_HTTPS*, *PAGERDUTY*, *SLACK*, *ORACLE_FUNCTIONS*, *SMS*. Look at https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/create-subscription.htm for details on protocol requirements.

A topic definition example is shown below. Multiple subscriptions and multiple protocols within a subscription are supported.
```
topics = {
  NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY = { # this key is referred by topic_keys within actions_topics attribute
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
    name = "vision-network-topic"
    subscriptions = [
      { protocol = "EMAIL", values = ["email.address@example.com"]}
    ]  
  }
}    
```

For managed streams, it is possible to specify the number of partitions and the retention (in hours), Their default values are 1 partition and 24 hours, respectively.
```
streams = {
  NETWORK-STREAM-KEY = { # this key is referred by stream_keys within actions_streams attribute
    name = "vision-network-stream"
    num_partitions = 2
    log_retention_in_hours = 48
  }
}
```
## External Dependencies

An optional feature, external dependencies are resources managed elsewhere that resources managed by this module may depend on. The following dependencies are supported:

- **compartments_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed compartments this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the compartment OCID.
- **topics_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed topics this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the topic OCID.
- **streams_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed streams this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the stream OCID.
- **functions_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed OCI functions this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the function OCID.

## An Example

Here's a sample setting as shown in [api-gateway-events example](./examples/api-gateway-events/README.md). In summary, the setting captures deployment changes in API Gateway (*supplied_events* attribute), filters them by *compartmentId* attribute (*attributes_filter* filter) as well as *CostCenter* and *OwnerEmail* tags in *OracleInternalReserved* namespace (*tags_filter* attribute).
The resulting events are sent to a topic defined by *APIGW-TOPIC-KEY* (*actions_topics* attribute) that is managed in the same configuration. The managed topic is named *apigw-topic* and subscribed by a single email address (*topics* attribute).

```
events_configuration = { 
  
  default_compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
  
  event_rules = {
    APIGW-EVENTS-KEY = { 
      event_display_name = "notify-on-api-gateway-deployments"
      event_description = "Monitoring deployment changes in API Gateway"
      supplied_events = ["com.oraclecloud.apigateway.createdeployment.end","com.oraclecloud.apigateway.deletedeployment.end","com.oraclecloud.apigateway.updatedeployment.end"]
      attributes_filter = [{
        attr = "compartmentId"
        value = ["ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...5ib"]
      }]
      tags_filter = [
        {
          namespace = "OracleInternalReserved"
          tags = [{name = "CostCenter", value = "1"}, {name = "OwnerEmail", value = "email.address@example.com"}]
        }
      ]
      destination_topic_ids = ["APIGW-TOPIC-KEY"]
    }
  }
    
  topics = {
    APIGW-TOPIC-KEY = {
      compartment_ocid = ""ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...6kc""
      name = "apigw-topic" 
      description = "Topic for API Gateway related notifications"
      subscriptions = [
        { protocol = "EMAIL"
          values = ["email.address@example.com"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}  
```
