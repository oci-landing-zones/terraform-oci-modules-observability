# OCI Landing Zone Alarms Module

![Landing Zone logo](../landing_zone_300.png)

This module manages monitoring alarms in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) based on a single configuration object. Alarms enable the active and passive monitoring of OCI resources. OCI Monitoring service uses metrics to monitor resources and alarms to notify interested parties when these metrics meet alarm-specified triggers. Alarms are an important consideration for gaining visibility about the health, capacity and performance of OCI resources, allowing for an informed and agile infrastructure management approach. 

Check [module specification](./SPEC.md) for a full description of module requirements, supported variables, managed resources and outputs.

Check the [examples](./examples/) folder for actual module usage.

## <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>
### Terraform Version >= 1.3.0

This module requires Terraform binary version 1.3.0 or greater, as it relies on Optional Object Type Attributes feature. The feature shortens the amount of input values in complex object types, by having Terraform automatically inserting a default value for any missing optional attributes.

### IAM Permissions

This module requires the following OCI IAM permissions in the compartments where alarms, topics, and streams are defined. 

For deploying alarms:
```
Allow group <group> to manage alarms in compartment <alarms-compartment-name>
Allow group <group> to read metrics in compartment <compartment-name>
```

For deploying topics:
```
Allow group <group> to manage ons-family in compartment <topic-compartment-name>
```

For deploying streams:
```
Allow group <group> to manage stream-family in compartment <compartment-name>
```

## <a name="invoke">How to Invoke the Module</a>

Terraform modules can be invoked locally or remotely. 

For invoking the module locally, just set the module *source* attribute to the module file path (relative path works). The following example assumes the module is two folders up in the file system.
```
module "alarms" {
  source = "../.."
  alarms_configuration = var.alarms_configuration
}
```

For invoking the module remotely, set the module *source* attribute to the alarms module folder in this repository, as shown:
```
module "alarms" {
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability/alarms"
  alarms_configuration = var.alarms_configuration
}
```
For referring to a specific module version, append *ref=\<version\>* to the *source* attribute value, as in:
```
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability//alarms?ref=v0.1.0"
```
## <a name="functioning">Module Functioning</a>

In this module, alarms are defined using the *alarms_configuration* object, that supports the following attributes:
- **default_compartment_id**: the default compartment for all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *compartment_id* attribute in each resource. This attribute is overloaded. It can be assigned either a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. The reserved key "TENANCY-ROOT" references the root compartment OCID. When "TENANCY-ROOT" is utilized, variable *tenancy_ocid* is required.
- **default_defined_tags**: the default defined tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *defined_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **default_freeform_tags**: the default freeform tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *freeform_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **alarms**: define the alarms to capture and where to send them. 
- **topics**: define the topics managed by this module that can be used as alarm destinations. 
- **streams**: define the streams managed by this module that can be used as alarm destinations.

**Note**: Each alarm, topic and stream are defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys.

## Defining the Alarms to Trigger

Within the *alarms* attribute, the alarms to trigger can be specific in two ways: through pre-configured alarm types or by supplying specific alarms.
- **pre-configured alarm types**: use the *preconfigured_alarm_type* attributes, assigning it a list of the following supported values: *high-cpu-alarm*, *instance-status-alarm*, *vm-maintenance-alarm*, *bare-metal-unhealthy-alarm*, *high-memory-alarm*, *adb-cpu-alarm*, *adb-storage-alarm*,*vpn-status-alarm* and *fast-connect-status-alarm*. For the list of metrics in each of these types, check [preconfigured_alarms.tf file](./preconfigured_alarms.tf).
- **supplied alarm**: use the *supplied_alarm* attribute, assigning its member attributes:
  - **query**: the Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. Example: "CpuUtilization[1m].mean() > 80".
  - **namespace**: indicator of the resource, service, or application that emits the metric. Example: "oci_computeagent".
  - **pending_duration**: the period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must persist before the alarm state changes from "OK" to "FIRING". For example, a value of 5 minutes means that the alarm must persist in breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "FIRING". Default is 5 minutes ("PT5M").
  - **severity**: the perceived type of response required when the alarm is in the "FIRING" state. Valid values are: "CRITICAL", "ERROR", "WARNING", "INFO". Default is "CRITICAL".
  - **message_format**: the format to use for notification messages sent from this alarm. Valid values are "RAW", "PRETTY_JSON" and "ONS_OPTMIZED". Default is "PRETTY_JSON".

Check [preconfigured_alarms.tf file](./preconfigured_alarms.tf) as examples on how to define these attributes and [Overview of Monitoring](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm) for details on OCI Monitoring service.

**Note**: *supplied_alarm* takes precedence over *preconfigured_alarm_type*.

### Naming Alarms

Use *display_name* attribute to name alarms.

### Defining Where to Send the Triggered Alarms

Within the *alarms* attribute, use *destination_topic_ids* and *destination_stream_ids* attributes to define where to send triggered alarms. 

- **destination_topic_ids**: a list of topics to send alarms to. This attribute is overloaded, i.e., it can be assigned a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. When assigned a reference, the module first looks up for the reference in the *topics* attribute for internally managed topics. Then it looks up in the *topics_dependency* variable for externally managed topics.
- **destination_stream_ids**: a list of streams to send alarms to. This attribute is overloaded, i.e., it can be assigned a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to an OCID. When assigned a reference, the module first looks up for the reference in the *streams* attribute for internally managed streams. Then it looks up in the *stream_dependency* variable for externally managed streams.

The example below shows the two destination types. Note that you can mix and match multiple OCIDs and references. 
```
destination_topic_ids = ["ocid1.onstopic.oc1.iad.aaaaaa...j5q","NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY"] 
destination_stream_ids = ["ocid1.stream.oc1.iad.aaaaaa...ijk","NETWORK-STREAM-KEY"] 
```

## Defining Alarm Destinations
Within *alarms_configuration*, use the *topics* and *streams* attributes to define the topics and streams destinations managed by this module.

**Each topic and stream is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined**. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys. 

For each topic in the *topics* attribute, you can define their associated *subscriptions*, by specifying  respective *protocol* and *values*. Supported protocols are *EMAIL*, *CUSTOM_HTTPS*, *PAGERDUTY*, *SLACK*, *ORACLE_FUNCTIONS*, *SMS*. Look at https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Notification/Tasks/create-subscription.htm for details on protocol requirements.

A topic definition example is shown below. Multiple subscriptions and multiple protocols within a subscription are supported.
```
topics = {
  NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY = { # this key is referred by destination_topic_ids attribute
    name = "vision-network-topic"
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
    subscriptions = [
      { protocol = "EMAIL", values = ["email.address@example.com"]}
    ]  
  }
}    
```

For managed streams, it is possible to specify the number of partitions and the retention (in hours), Their default values are 1 partition and 24 hours, respectively.
```
streams = {
  NETWORK-STREAM-KEY = { # this key is referred by destination_stream_ids attribute
    name = "vision-network-stream"
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
    num_partitions = 2
    log_retention_in_hours = 48
  }
}
```

## External Dependencies

An optional feature, external dependencies are resources managed elsewhere that resources managed by this module may depend on. The following dependencies are supported:

- **compartments_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed compartments this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the compartment OCID.
- **topics_dependency** : A map of objects containing the externally managed topics this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the topic OCID.
- **streams_dependency** : A map of objects containing the externally managed streams this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the stream OCID.

## An Example

Here's a sample configuration for sending pre-configured alarms of type "vpn-status-alarm" to a topic that is managed by this module. The topic is subscribed by "email.adress@example.com" email.

```
alarms_configuration = {
  default_compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
  
  alarms = {
    NETWORK-ALARM-VPN-STATUS-KEY = {
      display_name = "vpn-status-alarm"
      preconfigured_alarm_type = "vpn-status-alarm"
      destination_topic_ids = ["NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY"]
    }
  }
  topics = {
    NETWORK-TOPIC-KEY = {
      compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
      name = "network-topic"
      subscriptions = [
        { protocol = "EMAIL"
          values = ["email.adress@example.com"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
} 
```
