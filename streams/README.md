# OCI Landing Zone Streams Module

![Landing Zone logo](../landing_zone_300.png)

This module manages streams in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) based on a single configuration object. OCI Streaming service provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable solution for ingesting and consuming high-volume data streams in real-time. Streams are recommended for use cases where data is produced and processed continually and sequentially in a publish-subscribe messaging model. 

Check [module specification](./SPEC.md) for a full description of module requirements, supported variables, managed resources and outputs.

Check the [examples](./examples/) folder for actual module usage.

## <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>
### Terraform Version >= 1.3.0

This module requires Terraform binary version 1.3.0 or greater, as it relies on Optional Object Type Attributes feature. The feature shortens the amount of input values in complex object types, by having Terraform automatically inserting a default value for any missing optional attributes.

### IAM Permissions

This module requires the following OCI IAM permissions in the compartments where streams, keys (if encrypting streams with a customer managed key) and networking components (if deploying streams with private endpoints) are defined. 

For deploying streams:
```
Allow group <group> to manage stream-family in compartment <stream-compartment-name>
```

For encrypting streams with a customer managed key:
```
Allow service streaming to use keys in compartment <key-compartment-name> where target.key.id = '<key-ocid>'
Allow group <group> to use key-delegate in compartment <key-compartment-name> where target.key.id = '<key-ocid>'
```

For deploying streams with private endpoints:
```
Allow group <group> to use vnics in compartment <vnic-compartment-name>
Allow group <group> to use network-security-groups in compartment <nsg-compartment-name>
Allow group <group> to use subnets in compartment <subnet-compartment-name>
```

## <a name="invoke">How to Invoke the Module</a>

Terraform modules can be invoked locally or remotely. 

For invoking the module locally, just set the module *source* attribute to the module file path (relative path works). The following example assumes the module is two folders up in the file system.
```
module "streams" {
  source = "../.."
  streams_configuration = var.streams_configuration
}
```

For invoking the module remotely, set the module *source* attribute to the streams module folder in this repository, as shown:
```
module "streams" {
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability/streams"
  streams_configuration = var.streams_configuration
}
```
For referring to a specific module version, append *ref=\<version\>* to the *source* attribute value, as in:
```
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability//streams?ref=v0.1.0"
```
## <a name="functioning">Module Functioning</a>

In this module, streams are defined using the *streams_configuration* object, that supports the following attributes:
- **default_compartment_id**: the default compartment for all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *compartment_id* attribute in each resource. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either a compartment OCID or a reference (a key) to the compartment OCID.
- **default_defined_tags**: the default defined tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *defined_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **default_freeform_tags**: the default freeform tags that are applied to all resources managed by this module. It can be overriden by *freeform_tags* attribute in each resource.
- **streams**: the streams.
- **stream_pools**: any custom stream pools. 

## Defining Streams

Within *streams_configuration*, use the *streams* attribute to define the streams managed by this module. Each stream is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys.

The *streams* attribute supports the following attributes:
- **name**: the stream name.
- **compartment_id**: the compartment where the stream is created. Use it when the stream belongs to Default stream pool. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either a compartment OCID or a reference (a key) to the compartment OCID.
- **stream_pool_id**: the stream pool where the Stream belongs. It has precedence over *compartment_id*. Wen used, the stream is created in the same compartment as the stream pool. Use it when the stream belongs to a custom stream pool (defined in stream_pools). If set, this value must be set to a key in the stream_pools object.
- **num_partitions**: the number of stream partitions. Default is "1" partition.
- **log_retention_in_hours**: defines for how long log messages are kept. Default is "24" hours.
- **defined_tags**: the stream defined tags. *default_defined_tags* is used if this is not defined.
- **freeform_tags**: the stream freeform tags. *default_freeform_tags* is used if this is not defined.

The following example defines a stream with two partitions and a log retention time of fourty-eight hours. As *stream_pool_id* is not defined, the stream is associated with the Default stream pool.
```
streams = {
  NETWORK-STREAM = {
    name = "vision-network-stream"
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
    num_partitions = 2
    log_retention_in_hours = 48
  }
}
```

The following example defines a stream with one partitions and a log retention time of seventy-two hours. As *stream_pool_id* is defined, the stream is associated with the stream pool pointed by "MY-STREAM-POOL" key in *stream_pools* attribute. The *compartment_id* value is ignored, and the stream is created in the stream pool compartment.
```
streams = {
  NETWORK-STREAM = {
    name = "vision-network-stream"
    compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
    stream_pool_id = "MY-STREAM-POOL"
    num_partitions = 1
    log_retention_in_hours = 72
  }
}
```

## Defining (Custom) Stream Pools

Within *streams_configuration*, use the *stream_pools* attribute to define custom stream pools managed by this module. Each stream pool is defined as an object whose key must be unique and must not be changed once defined. As a convention, use uppercase strings for the keys. 

In OCI, every stream belongs to a stream pool, that defines common characteristics for all contained streams. A stream that is not explicitly assigned to a stream pool gets assigned to the Default stream pool.

The *stream_pools* attribute supports the following attributes:
- **name**: the stream pool name.
- **compartment_id**: the compartment where the stream pool is created. default_compartment_id is used if undefined. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either a compartment OCID or a reference (a key) to the compartment OCID.
- **kms_key_id**: the customer managed key used to encrypt streams in the Stream Pool. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either an encryption Key OCID or a reference (a key) to the encryption Key OCID.
- **private_endpoint_settings**: settings for private endpoints. Use this to restrict traffic to streams in the stream pool to a private endpoint, thus avoiding that traffic traverse the Internet. The following attributes are supported:
  - **subnet_id**: the subnet the stream pool is assigned. This value cannot be changed once assigned. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either a subnet OCID or a reference (a key) to the subnet OCID.
  - **private_endpoint_ip**: the IP address for the Stream Pool. A random IP address from the subnet is assigned if undefined. It must be in the CIDR range of the subnet specified by *subnet_id*. If not specified, a randomly IP address taken from the subnet IP range is assigned. After the stream pool is created, a custom Fully Qualified Domaind Name (FQDN), pointing to this private IP, is created. The FQDN is then used to access the service instead of the private IP.
  - **nsg_ids**: the network security groups the stream pool IP address is added to. Access to the streams is only possible if allowed by the NSG security rules. This value cannot be changed once assigned. This attribute is overloaded: it can be either NSGs OCIDs or references (keys) to the NSGs OCIDs.
- **kafka_settings**: settings for the Kafka APIs compatibility layer. The following attributes are supported:
  - **auto_create_topics_enabled**: determines whether topics are automatically created on the server. This is the equivalent to the Kafka setting "auto.create.topics.enable" Default is false.
  - **bootstrap_servers**: the bootstrap servers to use with Kafka client.
  - **log_retention_in_hours**: determines for how long messages are kept in the stream pool streams. Default is 24 hours.
  - **num_partitions**: the number of stream partitions in the stream pool. Default is 1 partition.  
- **defined_tags**: the stream pool defined tags. *default_defined_tags* is used if this is not defined.
- **freeform_tags**: the stream pool freeform tags. *default_freeform_tags* is used if this is not defined.

The following example defines a stream pool where streams are encrypted with a customer managed key (*kms_key_id*) and are only reachable by producers and consumers that can access the subnet (*subnet_id*) and are authorized by the security rules in the network security groups (*nsg_ids*). The commented out attributes (preceded by #) are shown for awareness.
```
stream_pools = {
    MY-STREAM-POOL = {
      name = "vision-stream-pool"
      compartment_id = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaa...4ja"
      kms_key_id = "ocid1.key.oc1..bzqwnr...zsq"
      private_endpoint_settings = {
        subnet_id = "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaaaaa...e7a"
      # private_endpoint_ip = null
        nsg_ids = "ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1..aaaaaa...xlq"
      }
      #kafka_settings = {
      #  auto_create_topics_enabled = false
      #  bootstrap_servers = null
      #  log_retention_in_hours = 24
      #  num_partitions = 1
      #}
      #defined_tags = null
      #freeform_tags = null
    }
  }
```

## External Dependencies

An optional feature, external dependencies are resources managed elsewhere that resources managed by this module may depend on. The following dependencies are supported:

- **compartments_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed compartments this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the compartment OCID.
- **kms_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed encryption keys this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the encryption key OCID.
- **network_dependency**: A map of objects containing the externally managed subnets and NSGs this module may depend on. All map objects must have the same type and must contain at least an *id* attribute with the subnet OCID and NSG OCID.
